      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
          Hello! My name is Catalina Lemus. I am a sophomore at Virginia Tech's College
          of Engineering majoring in Computer Science and Minoring in Human Computer
          Interaction. I am very interested in Software Engineering. I love the 
          creativity of Computer Science and the constant problem solving like puzzles.
          I am always trying to learn something new and currently I am interested in VR 
          so I have a current position as an intern for Undergraduate Research in 3D User
          Interfaces.
      </p>
      <p>
        In my free time I love to go hiking. I have a chocolate labrador named Chewy and
        a german shepherd named Luna that I take hiking with me all the time. Lately I have
        been hiking in Shenandoah National park and its great! I also love watching movies
        and TV shows. I like a big range of shows such as Criminal Minds and Hells Kitchen.
        I also love art and this has motivated me with Computer Science since there are so
        many opportunities to do something creative and new.

          Here are some of my more recent projects:
      </p>
      <ul>
          <li>
              Research Work in 3D User Interfaces: I have been building
              the interactive aspects of a webpage for a forestry group
              in Blacksburg. I am currently working on the way the site 
              will behave on a mobile device with movement. The goal is 
              to have the picture move with the phone.
          </li>
          <li>
              Mobile App project using Flutter: I have been collaborating
              with a friend to build a mobile app that can be used for
              people in high school and older to find mentors.
          </li>
          <li>
              Hanoi Tower Puzzle Solver: For my Data Structures a built an
              application that solves a Hanoi Tower Puzzle. This included 
              a frontend that shows the movement of each disk in the Tower
              until solved.
