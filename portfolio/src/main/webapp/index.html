          Hello! My name is Catalina Lemus. I am a sophomore at Virginia Tech's College
          of Engineering majoring in Computer Science and Minoring in Human Computer
          Interaction. I am very interested in Software Engineering. I love the 
          creativity of Computer Science and the constant problem solving like puzzles.
          I am always trying to learn something new and currently I am interested in VR 
          so I have a current position as an intern for Undergraduate Research in 3D User
          Interfaces.

        In my free time I love to go hiking. I have a chocolate labrador named Chewy and
        a german shepherd named Luna that I take hiking with me all the time. Lately I have
        been hiking in Shenandoah National park and its great! I also love watching movies
        and TV shows. I like a big range of shows such as Criminal Minds and Hells Kitchen.
        I also love art and this has motivated me with Computer Science since there are so
        many opportunities to do something creative and new.
